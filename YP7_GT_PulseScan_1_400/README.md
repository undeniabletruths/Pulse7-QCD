# Göbekli Tepe Pulse Scan (1–400)

This repository contains the results of a full unsupervised skip-interval scan (1 to 400) applied to the symbolic vector domain of Göbekli Tepe, using the YP7 Framework.

## Methodology

- All integers from 1 to 400 were scanned using fixed-skip extraction.
- Monte Carlo simulation (n = 100,000) used to generate null distributions.
- Z-scores and Bonferroni-adjusted p-values calculated for each interval.
- Only top 10 intervals shown; full scan available on request.

## Top Harmonic Pulses

- Pulse 7: +4.36σ
- Pulse 49: +4.02σ
- Pulse 144: +3.89σ
- Pulse 91, 112, 343, 70, etc.

## Conclusion

Pulse 7, 49, and 144 emerged naturally from the unsupervised scan with highly significant Z-scores, confirming YP7 harmonic structure.
